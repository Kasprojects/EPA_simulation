## Introduction

Climate change is effecting us all in types of different forms. Bangladesh is no exception to this as it faces severe cyclones, floods, and earthquake which damage the infrastructure in the country. The focus of this study lies on the identification of critical infrastructure in Bangladesh in order to prevent crucial infrastructure loss leading to high decrease in national mobility. 

Data used in this study was obtained from the Bangladesh National Archives and sorted between several files by academia from the TU Delft. These files are known to contain several errors and inconsistencies. This creates the urge for the first part of this project, which is the cleaning of the datafiles. The objective is to identify the errors based on literature and providing solutions to them in the form of algorithms. 
Within this objective, the study focusses on two subobjectives: the errors in the series of geographical points that represent roads and errors in the mapping of bridges. 

## Content information
- Readme file 
- A report in the form of a pdf file (in report folder)
- Data files in several formats (in data folder)

## Types of data files and how to use it 
The project is provided with several folders. 
All of the folder names suggest what can be found in the folders. For example, the data is provided in the folder named "data".
For the project a selection of datafiles were used:

#### BMMS_overview
A generated Excel file used by the simulation to draw the bridges. It contains specific information concerning the bridge such as the name, type and coordinates of the bridge. For this study the name of the road which the brigde was coupled with is used to compare with the _roads file. 

#### _roads
A csv file containing the road name of every road and all the data points represented in the positions of the LRP points. For every LRP point the coordinates are given in the form of latitude and longitude values. 

#### Roads_InfoAboutEachLRP
A csv file with detailed information about the LRP points of roads.
