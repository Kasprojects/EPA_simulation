## Introduction

In the folder (EPA1352-Gxx-Ax), you place your lab submission.



## How to Use


Include whatever you think is necessary for someone to understand your work. The README file is usually the first file someone will see and open. It doesn't need to explain what might be obvious, but it should point out the most important things someone looking at your work should know. What is your work for? What are the most important files? Who (if anyone) funded the project?

There are a number of folders provided to structure your work. Use the ones that fit your needs. No all folders have to be filled. 

### Format

Most README files for data or software projects are now written in Markdown format, like this document. There are some different flavours, but they are based on the same logic â€“ being easy to write. 
Use Markdown format for your README file as well.
