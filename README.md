## Introduction

Climate change is effecting us all in types of different forms. Bangladesh is no exception to this as it faces severe cyclones, floods, and earthquake which damage the infrastructure in the country. The focus of this study lies on the identification of critical infrastructure in Bangladesh in order to prevent crucial infrastructure loss leading to high decrease in national mobility. 

Data used in this study was obtained from the Bangladesh National Archives and sorted between several files by academia from the TU Delft. These files are known to contain several errors and inconsistencies. This creates the urge for the first part of this project, which is the cleaning of the datafiles. The objective is to identify the errors based on literature and providing solutions to them in the form of algorithms. 
Within this objective, the study focusses on two subobjectives: the errors in the series of geographical points that represent roads and errors in the mapping of bridges. 

## Data files 

For the project a selection of datafiles were used:
* BMMS_overview
```
A generated Excel file used by the simulation to draw the bridges. It contains specific information concerning the bridge such as the name, type and coordinates of the bridge. 

* _roads
A csv file with

The 

Include whatever you think is necessary for someone to understand your work. The README file is usually the first file someone will see and open. It doesn't need to explain what might be obvious, but it should point out the most important things someone looking at your work should know. What is your work for? What are the most important files? Who (if anyone) funded the project?

There are a number of folders provided to structure your work. Use the ones that fit your needs. No all folders have to be filled.
